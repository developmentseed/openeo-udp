    "# Burned Area Index for Sentinel-2 (BAIS2) and openEO\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to detect burned area at 20 m spatial resolution using Sentinel-2 imagery. The new MSI sensor aboard Sentinel-2 satellites carries more spectral information recorded in the red-edge spectral region, opening the development BAIS2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. Connect to an OpenEO backend service\n",
    "2. Define an area of interest containing terrestrial land, such as Las Palmas de Grand Canaria, Spain\n",
    "3. Load Sentinel-2-L2A imagery for a specific date, which is 19 August 2019\n",
    "4. Calculate BAIS2 and estimate burn scars on land\n",
    "5. Generate a color-mapped visualization based on the minimum and maximum values of BAIS2\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is BAIS2?\n",
    "BAIS2 is a spectral index to map burned areas using the red-edge spectral region of Sentinel-2, along with the NIR and SWIR bands. The red-edge region, a strong descriptor of chlorophyll content, is suitable for discriminating burn severity at 20 m spatial resolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The index ranges from -1 to 1 for burn scars and 1 to 6 for active fires, though thresholds may varu with fire intensity and were originally calibrated for Mediterranean environments. BAIS2 enables a reliable detection of fire-damaged areas and supports burned-area mapping from high-resolution optical satellite data. BAIS2 is  calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "BAIS2 = \\Bigl(1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{B06 \\times B07 \\times B8A}{B04}}\\Bigr) \\times \\Bigl(\\frac{B12 - B8A}{\\sqrt{B12 + B8A}} + 1\\Bigr)\n",

    "- Burned area mapping: Detecting and delineating burn scars using Sentinel-2 red-edge bands\n",
    "- Fire severity assessment: Using BAIS2 and dBAIS2 (Difference Burned Area Index for Sentinel-2) to evaluate changes in fire severity pre- and post-fire\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Overview\n",
    "- The method had been tested to map wildfires in Sicily region, Italy, in 2017. BAIS2 results showed good agreements with the burned area polygons of Copernicus EMS products. The test also highlighted utilising the BAIS2 with biophysical estimates such as LAF for the evaluation of fire severity levels in a more comprehensive manner\n",
    "- BAIS2 is derived from Sentinel-2 MSI red-edge spectral bands, which are good indicators for chlorophyll contents\n",
    "- The adoption of difference indices (i.e., dBAIS2 and dNBR) is demonstrated to gather better results when compared to a single temporal observation because they rely on the estimation of changing vegetation cover\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance and Insights\n",
    "- Good discrimination of burned areas\n",
    "- Burn severity classification can be dataset-dependent, with common misclassification at low-severity levels\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- Water masking required. Water bodies could be removed to avoid false burn signals due to spectral darkness\n",
    "- Cloud shadows could be masked to prevent misclassification\n",
    "- Index thresholds vary with region and acquisition conditions\n",
    "- Charcoal remval and early vegetation regrowth can affect SWIR-based indices\n",
    "- Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) should be minimized to enable reliable mapping of surface features and the detection of surface change, as well as to provide consistent sensor data comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Practices\n",
    "- Use difference indices for detecting changes due to fire\n",
    "- Employ dense time series to identify fire timing, reduce classification errors, and mitigate SWIR reflectance variability\n",
    "- Apply robust masking (water, cloud, shadow) before analysis\n",
