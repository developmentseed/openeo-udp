    "# Aquatic Plants and Algae Detection (APA) with OpenEO\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the detection of aquatic plants and algae in water bodies using Sentinel-2 imagery with the OpenEO API. The algorithm is based on the Aquatic Plants and Algae Custom Script Detector (APA Script) developed by Anna Péliova, Carla Garcia-Lozano and Josep Sitjar from the University of Girona.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. Connect to an OpenEO backend service\n",
    "2. Define an area of interest containing water bodies\n",
    "3. Load Sentinel-2 L2A imagery for a specific date\n",
    "4. Calculate and visualize the Aquatic Plants and Algae Index (APA)\n",
    "5. Create a web service for real-time visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is APA?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Aquatic Plants and Algae Index (APA) is designed to highlight the presence of floating aquatic vegetation and algae in water bodies. It combines multiple spectral indices to enhance the visibility of these features while filtering out clouds and land areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses:\n",
    "- **Floating Algae Index (FAI)**: Detects floating vegetation and algae using NIR bands\n",
    "- **Water Plants Index**: Uses red and red-edge bands to identify aquatic vegetation\n",
    "- **Water Body Detection**: Combines NDWI and moisture indices to identify water surfaces\n",
    "- **Cloud Masking**: Applies cloud detection to avoid false positives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Indices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**FAI = B08 - [B04 + (B11 - B04) × (832.8 - 664.6) / (1613.7 - 664.6)]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Water Plants = (B05 - B04) / (B05 + B04)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**NDWI = (B03 - B08) / (B03 + B08)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moisture = (B8A - B11) / (B8A + B11)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Color Scheme:\n",
    "- **Blue**: Clear water\n",
    "- **Turquoise**: Low density aquatic vegetation/algae\n",
    "- **Green**: Medium density aquatic vegetation/algae\n",
    "- **Yellow**: High density aquatic vegetation/algae\n",
    "- **Brown to purple**: Turbid water with sediments\n",
    "- **True color**: Land areas and clouds\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is particularly useful for:\n",
    "- **Invasive Species Monitoring**: Detection of water hyacinth and other invasive aquatic plants\n",
    "- **Ecosystem Health Assessment**: Monitoring aquatic vegetation distribution\n",
    "- **Water Quality Monitoring**: Identifying areas affected by algal blooms\n",
    "- **Environmental Management**: Supporting decision-making for lake and lagoon management\n",
    "- **Research**: Studying spatial and temporal distribution of aquatic vegetation"

    "| Color | Meaning | Interpretation |\n",
    "|-------|---------|----------------|\n",
    "| **True color** | Land areas, clouds | Normal terrestrial features |\n",
    "| **Blue** | Clear water | Clean water bodies without vegetation |\n",
    "| **Turquoise** | Low density aquatic vegetation | Sparse floating plants or algae |\n",
    "| **Green** | Medium density aquatic vegetation | Moderate aquatic plant coverage |\n",
    "| **Yellow** | High density aquatic vegetation | Dense aquatic plant coverage or algal blooms |\n",
    "| **Brown to purple** | Turbid water | Water with high sediment content |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Invasive Species Monitoring**: \n",
    "   - Detection of water hyacinth (*Eichhornia crassipes*)\n",
    "   - Monitoring spread of other invasive aquatic plants\n",
    "   - Supporting management and control efforts\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ecosystem Health Assessment**:\n",
    "   - Tracking natural aquatic vegetation distribution\n",
    "   - Monitoring seasonal changes in vegetation coverage\n",
    "   - Assessing habitat quality for aquatic wildlife\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Water Quality Monitoring**:\n",
    "   - Early detection of algal blooms\n",
    "   - Identifying areas with high nutrient loading\n",
    "   - Supporting water treatment planning\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Environmental Management**:\n",
    "   - Supporting lake and reservoir management decisions\n",
    "   - Informing agricultural water use planning\n",
    "   - Guiding conservation efforts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weather Sensitivity**: Recent rainfall can cause false detections on land areas with high moisture content\n",
    "2. **Shallow Water**: May be misclassified as highly vegetated areas\n",
    "3. **Atmospheric Conditions**: High-altitude clouds (cirrus) may be classified as turbid areas\n",
    "4. **Aerosol Interference**: Over ocean areas, atmospheric aerosols may cause false green detections\n",
    "5. **Temporal Resolution**: Sentinel-2 revisit time may miss rapid changes in aquatic vegetation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Selection**: Choose scenes with low cloud cover (< 30%) and minimal atmospheric interference\n",
    "2. **Seasonal Timing**: Consider seasonal patterns of aquatic vegetation growth in your study area\n",
    "3. **Ground Truth**: Validate results with field observations or high-resolution imagery when possible\n",
    "4. **Time Series**: Use multiple dates to track changes and reduce false positives\n",
    "5. **Regional Adaptation**: The algorithm may need fine-tuning for specific regional conditions"

    "## Technical Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences from Original Evalscript:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decimal Notation**: The original script used European comma notation (832,8) which has been converted to decimal points (832.8) for Python compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process Graph Structure**: The original JavaScript conditional statements have been converted to OpenEO's nested `if_` process calls.\n",

    "3. **Band Access**: Direct band access (B04, B05, etc.) has been replaced with array indexing appropriate for OpenEO data cubes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Color Scaling**: Added linear scaling (0-255) for proper RGB visualization in the OpenEO framework.\n",

    "5. **Parameter Definition**: Added configurable parameters for spatial extent, temporal extent, and bands to make the algorithm reusable.\n",
